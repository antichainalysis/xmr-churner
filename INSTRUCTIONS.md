# Instructions

The only way `moneroc` will work is if you have your funds to distribute and churn in Account 0.

- Make a new wallet
- Transfer the amount of funds you want to distribute and churn into Account 0 (primary/first index) into that new wallet you just made.
- Make sure you are running your [OWN monero node](https://www.getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/vps_run_node.html)
- Install [`moneroc`](https://github.com/antichainalysis/xmr-churner/blob/main/README.md#usage)
