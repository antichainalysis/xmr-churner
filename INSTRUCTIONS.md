# Instructions

The only way `moneroc` will work is if you have your funds to distribute and churn in Account 0.

- Make sure you are running your [OWN monero node](https://www.getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/vps_run_node.html)
- Make a new wallet via monero-wallet-rpc
- Transfer (all) the amount of funds you want to distribute and churn into Account 0 (primary/first index) into that new wallet you just created.
- Once you have your monero node daemon set up, connect your wallet to the daemon and get the monero-wallet-rpc URL
- Install [`moneroc`](https://github.com/antichainalysis/xmr-churner/blob/main/README.md#usage)
